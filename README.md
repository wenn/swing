# Swing
Folder manager, swing from one tree to another by their name instead of their folder paths.

## Setup
1. Download _setup\_swing.sh_ somewhere (e.g. ~/.scripts/setup\_swing.sh)
2. Add to _~/.bash\_rc_: `source ~/.scripts/setup_swing.sh`

## Usage
1. `swing init [name]` add current folder, defaults to folder name
2. `swing <folder name>` cd to folder

## TODO
- Add a clean method to remove obselete paths
